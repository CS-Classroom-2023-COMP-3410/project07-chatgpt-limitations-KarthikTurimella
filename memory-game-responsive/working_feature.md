Hereâ€™s a brief summary of the changes I made:

1. **HTML**:
   - Structured the game layout with a `game-container`, `game-header` for controls, and `game-grid` for the card display.
   - Added a `fruit-border` div for the animated fruit decorations.

2. **CSS**:
   - Styled the body and game container for centering.
   - Set the dimensions and styles for the grid and buttons.
   - Added styles for the fruit-border and animations.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Updated the script to properly handle the game logic, card flipping, timer, and moves counter.
   - Enhanced fruit border animations for visual appeal around the game grid.
   - Incorporated event listeners for starting and restarting the game, with proper animations.

This setup ensures the game works smoothly with animated fruit decorations around the grid and proper gameplay mechanics.
